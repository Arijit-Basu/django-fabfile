Features & Assumptions:
- Fabfile for fully automated Django project installation and deploy process on an Ubuntu 10.4 server
- Stack: nginx, Apache, Django, PostgreSQL, Postfix
- Cooperates with siblings -- run multiple of these on the same server
- All services run on a single server

Non-features:
- Sites running across multiple servers (e.g., a separate database server, or multiple web servers. This is available in a branch, but you might not like it.
- Compatibility with servers running sites or services other than those on this exact setup. The Fabfile overwrites nginx settings etc.
- Accepting inbound mail
- Configuration tuned for high traffic. Set your own values in the `server` directory's various config files.
- Running on servers other than Ubuntu 10.4

Currently non-configurable, but modifying the source shouldn't be too hard: 
- Runs your site from www.yourdomain.com
- Static files are served out of /static/

Caveats:
- Written for Fabric <1.0, haven't fully updated it yet
- I haven't tried running this from Windows
